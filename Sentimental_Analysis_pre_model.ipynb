Immediately holding press conferences appears to be standard behaviour during this outbreak; for example, Imperial and Oxford both did the same. In fact in the Oxford case the press published stories about the paper before it was even available <i>anywhere</i>, let alone in a journal.<p>I understand why at the moment peer review is being short circuited by everyone, regardless of political or epidemiological position. The world is hungry for news and journalists will interpret papers with or without the help of the authors. Might as well have their assistance, in these circumstances.<p>Your remark about &quot;conservative news outlets&quot; shows what&#x27;s really going on here, I suspect - just another day in politically biased academia-land. If you talk to anything other than CNN then you&#x27;re bad and wrong. The same has been seen with Alex Berenson, a former NYT journalist turned novelist who has never really taken part in politics nor even really discussed it much in public. Once he started tweeting skeptically about the actions of governments and academics, all based on public data, he discovered only the conservative news outlets were willing to interview him. And then that mere fact alone was used by the left to attack him, although his points were all based on actual verifiable facts and had no pre-existing political bias.<p>Ioannidis made a lot of enemies by kickstarting the replication crisis. Now it looks like some see a chance to get back at him.\n",

            "Yes, that&#x27;s a textbook scenario that makes sense when the economy is functioning as it should. To truly understand how it applies in these current times you would need to take a systems-thinking approach.<p>Sure, someone getting in wants to buy at half price, but the existing people want to sell as soon as they hear about a potential issue diluting their ownership&#x2F;price&#x2F;dividend. Then the company might get a reputation for a tendency to issue shares and investors will see it as less attractive (buybacks are attractive).<p>Now, let&#x27;s say a bunch of companies need this money, maybe like the $1T in US bailout money (Not including the other $1T+ in stimulus). Where does that money come from? Some of the largest financial companies have about $5T AUM, but it&#x27;s already invested. A stock issue will only erode the value they have to work with. Billionaires and millionaires are typically listed as that based on ownership of assets (stock in their company), not what&#x27;s in the bank, so they don&#x27;t have enough cash to make an impact. We are close to 20% unemployment, so this tends to rule out the masses from investing new money on a large enough scale to make that sort of systemic impact (not to mention that the masses generally shy away from investing in individual stocks).<p>We are a consumption based economy and when consumption rapidly declines, and even goes to near zero for some industries, then the system will not produce the textbook outcomes. Talk to professionals, they will tell you they have seen some odd things in the past few months.<p>Bonds would typically be a better way for the company to adjust their capital short-term for a number of reasons like not constantly buying back and issuing stock. Of course that market has been screwed up since the last recession, so this textbook approach isn&#x27;t likely to be effective either.\n",

After all how could we, with our superior health system and our governments that would react quickly and rationally on such a trivial threat as this.<p>When the virus had reached Europe, it had already reached South Korea and Taiwan as well. These countries had learned from the earlier SARS outbreak how to deal with it and thoroughly tested everyone that could possibly have the virus, symptoms or not.

Well because of what actually.<p>Now that the pandemic has wrecked havoc in the entire Western world and most people are realising that a strategy of first constraining the virus (like in Wuhan) and then testing everybody to contain in (like in South Korea) is the only realistic way to deal with it, one might think that a bit of humbleness towards Asia would be in place.\n",

            "A couple of points. On this. Phone cameras are mainly used by people who don&#x27;t intend to do any (or only very minor editing). Overall, both IOS and Android can produce great results even with mediocre lenses&#x2F;sensors. Computational photography basically enables them to compensate for that and machine learned configuration of editing steps a pro would do manually actually produce nice results. Of course these results are not intended for further post processing and lot of the applied edits are lossy in the sense of compressing dynamic range, clipping blacks for contrasty look and feel, blurring out noise &amp; detail not visible on a tiny screen, etc. But considering iphones have very high resolution screens these days that should still be fine for that and simple prints. But lets be real, most of this stuff gets produced for and consumed on phone screens by people who are not even close to being decent amateur photographers.<p>But for anyone who is used to dealing with proper gear (cameras &amp; lenses) and having the freedom to make very subjective artistic choices for things like white balance, local contrast, tone mapping, noise reduction, etc. what a phone does is always a compromise. And also it&#x27;s a 1 size fits all solution optimized for mass appeal, which usually means &quot;oooooh blue sky, pretty saturated colors, super sharp&#x2F;contrasty photos&quot;, which as any postprocessing enthusiast knows are all variations of compressing dynamic range (i.e. super lossy steps).<p>I fall in the last category but I do appreciate the best effort my cheap Nokia 7 Plus camera app makes. I occasionally use open camera to get raw dngs for editing in Darktable but they actually do a decent job with the jpgs given the noisy original. My shiny new Fuji X-T30 produces much nicer raw files with tons of dynamic range and detail that simply is not there on a mobile phone. All of the AI stuff that happens in a phone you can also do with a decent camera but it requires lots of specialized tools and tweaking (e.g. hugin for hdr stuff).<p>But the best camera is the one you have with you and for most of us that&#x27;s usually a smart phone.\n",

The way that it works is that the AI has memorized the small-scale details from millions of good photos taken with large lenses and proper equipment, and that way it can replace the noisy phone sensor data with its noise-free counterpart.<p>However, such an AI currently needs 10GB of GPU RAM and it runs for 2 seconds on my 1080 TI for a 4K image.

If you look at just texts, older people use proper caps, but younger people don’t. Of course this is not out of laziness — but because caps and no caps leave different psychological imprints.<p>‘Hey!’ and ‘hey’ are totally different and convey very different meanings. (-&gt; medium is the message)<p>Particularly meme-y, edgy, distant, and cool content likes no caps (e.g. Billie Eilish song titles).<p>As to programming, I like nocaps because it makes things less formal. It makes things more bound to change, because code should read more live than fixed. It’s more sandbox and less tablet.<p>This is why to me Haskell, in all its greatness, feels too rigid. Too many caps (among other things). There has to be a psychologically lighter version of ‘Maybe Int = Just Int | Nothing’. Feels too much like rules written, less exploratory.<p>Also caps in general are more psychologically distant (and effortful) than the underscore approach, because it uses lots of chord+keys (caps) instead of single keys. Swapping dash and underscore (and dvorak and smart hotkey handling) also achieve similar effects. Small costs add up, especially when lots of tiny decisions are involved.<p>Psychology of representation is a subtle art that is often overlooked.

I went from a perfectly healthy individual to a familiar face in the ER in a matter of days (4 times there in a span of a month). I took prednisone for 6 months. All tests came fine. In the eyes of modern medicine, I was still a perfectly healthy individual. My doctor told me that that is the case with 95% of the people with chronic allergies - we simply don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s the root cause of their problem. In other words, the immune system is extraordinarily complex, and if you could avoid messing up with it, you should probably do that.<p>Now, a vaccine does exactly that. It plays some games with the immune system. Sometimes the outcome of the game is weird, just take a look at [1].

Vinyl sounds &quot;nice&quot; because recording and playback add distortion and noise at the low end, which gives bass and drums more weight, while the top end is smooth and extends higher than CD - which sounds like &quot;air&quot; because any intermodulation distortion in the amp and speakers will fold it back to audibility, even though nominally it&#x27;s ultrasonic.<p>Chemical film creates distortions of its own. Colour film often pushes the reds to make skin tones, lipstick, and sunsets warmer.

Putting aside the fact that it’s not exactly obvious when non-ICE cars will take over the majority of the market from ICE cars (I wouldn’t bet on it happening before my yet to be born children get their drivers licenses), it’s definitely not obvious that electric cars will be the ones to do it. I’ve driven both battery electric cars and hydrogen cars, and hydrogen cars offer a far superior driving experience. Charging an electric car simply sucks. It’s also not clear how you’d expect to manage charging stations at scale. It take 75 minutes for a full charge on a Tesla, nobody enjoys waiting that long for their car to charge, and the amount of Superchargers you’d need across the country&#x2F;world would be insane if a majority of cars were electric. Hydrogen cars don’t have that problem, and they don’t have the same hard constraints on range.<p>You can say that hydrogen car tech, or the infrastructure, isn’t there yet.

I would agree with most of the sentiment on here that they are more complex, though not because of Saga&#x27;s API but because one really has to understand the core workings of the framework to not screw the pooch. For many their first exposure to generators is via Saga and that is just the tip of the iceberg. One really needs to understand what all the takes are doing as well as how Saga utilizes async and await style logic. To me, Saga&#x27;s a very readable and very easy to debug but some dragons lie below the API and one has to understand that those dragons are doing magic a lot differently that other frameworks do magic. It&#x27;s just not a framework where you get to ignore what the magic is doing for you as you will create nasty bugs due to lack of understanding about what the framework is trying to do and it becomes easy to fight against it out of ignorance.

The sensor size doesn&#x27;t actually matter; you can crop a photo later (which is like using a smaller sensor) and the depth of field doesn&#x27;t change.

That means that a 35mm camera will use a 50mm &quot;normal&quot; lens, and a 4x5 camera will use a 150mm &quot;normal&quot; lens.   Attach a 50mm lens to a 35mm camera, take a picture, replace the camera with a 150mm lens on a 4x5 camera, and objects in each photograph will be about the same size.  But, the 150mm lens will obviously produce more blurring away from the focal plane; that&#x27;s just what longer lenses do.<p>The iPhone&#x27;s telephoto lens has a 6mm focal length, and so tends to produce an image with more in focus than a lens that&#x27;s 25x longer.<p>(Why do phones use a 6mm lens and not a 150mm lens?

            "Some of the depth blur fakery occasionally fails so badly I get dizzy when looking at it because my brain is wired for shooting and editing DSLR images that have been shot in RAW mode.  Since I&#x27;ve short DSLRs for almost 20 years now, my workflow is wired to work with the technology and its limitations.  And DSLRs have some significant limitations.<p><i>Let&#x27;s forget about the limitations of small sensors and tiny optics for a bit. It&#x27;s a phone and not a DSLR or a medium format camera with glass that costs more than your car.  It can only do so much.</i>.<p>When I shoot I aim for data capture and not how the image looks as shot.  How it looks comes later.  Which, in overly simplified terms, means: don&#x27;t blow out the highlights ever and try to keep the noise level in the shadows as low as possible.  Or in other words: try to get as much as possible within the dynamic range of the sensor at the lowest possible sensitivity (amplification?) setting of the sensor.  (I&#x27;m not fond of large grain - artificial or otherwise).<p>The post processing is essentially about taking more data that your output medium can reasonably render and then offset, squeeze and stretch parts of the dynamic range until you get the tonality you want from the data you have.<p>Even the iPhone 6 did an amazing job at automating this.  But I can&#x27;t help but feel that with each generation, iPhones get a little bit worse.  It tries to do more, which means that when it gets things wrong, the results can get really horrible.  And I&#x27;m not fond of images that have had heavy alterations of pixels.<p>Sure, most people aren&#x27;t going to see this when the image is rendered on a surface that isn&#x27;t that much bigger than a baseball card.  And sure, for most pictures it probably isn&#x27;t going to be as noticable for the 2 seconds they spend looking at it.<p>And as someone else pointed out, if you are going to fake focus blur, you&#x27;re going to have to do a hell of a lot more complex stuff than just smearing pixels with gaussian blur or any other blurring method that doesn&#x27;t model how lenses actually work.<p>If you want a really stark example, take a 85mm Petzval lens, or some other &quot;bokeh monster&quot;, shoot it wide open with a foreground subject that is 2m away against a background that is 4-5 meters away that contains lots of small highlights.  Then repeat the same with various iPhones.<p>No the iPhone doesn&#x27;t have a Petzval lens or any other (relatively) large lens.  So why try to fake that you do?  If you want the visual effects of large glass then shoot with large glass.<p>As a hobbyist photographer I find it easier when a camera doesn&#x27;t try to be clever.  When it just does what it does.  To me a mobile phone camera is more of a &quot;documentation camera&quot; - it should try to capture what you are interested in.  It doesn&#x27;t always have to be pretty.  It just needs to be reasonably accurate.  Subtly applied HDR tricks are okay since it helps you capture what you are looking at, but when you start to alter pixels, it becomes less useful as a tool.\n",

            "High schooler here.  On-line school is far from perfect.  There are two approaches I&#x27;ve seen:<p>1. The &quot;self-taught&quot; style.  This one is being done by my linear algebra class: the prof tells us which chapters to read, sends out notes, and some recommended problems.  Periodically, he sends out a take-home test; we work it and send him the answers.  This style is helped by the fact that our book is short and concise enough to teach but still be readable.  No one wants to read if a chapter takes hours.  This approach works great for me, but it requires a more self-directed student to function.<p>2. The &quot;micro-manager&quot; style.  This one is being done by my physics class: the prof uses online, checked homework, multiple zoom calls, requires us to record videos of ourselves solving problems in a &quot;tutorial style&quot;, gives on-line quizzes, and attempts to give the same tests on-line as were given in-person.  This results in horrible, invasive solutions that give a &quot;proctor&quot; remote access to one&#x27;s computer, require one to use a webcam to be monitored, and require one to show the space around him using a mirror.  This style is awful, wastes colossal amounts of time, but is the option on which teachers fall back when they lack confidence in their students to be self-directed.<p>Most teachers are going for option 2, which is worse than in-person learning.  This may sound cynical, but mot of the tools for &quot;active learning&quot; or &quot;on-line engagement&quot; make students&#x27; lives harder, waste their time, and offer no benefit beyond an administrator feeling as though he&#x27;s &quot;done something&quot;.<p>Edit: can any current student tell me if y&#x27;all are getting refunded for room and board, at least partially?

Thinking that separating technologies for technologies sake somehow made code more maintainable but the reality is, that it was dogma, if a snippet of JS, a snippet of CSS and a snippet of HTML will only ever be used as a black box component and only ever be reused as that black box component in total, separation of technology only leads to more complexity in interfile dependency and mental compos-ability of the whole solution in ones mind.

Why would anyone donate to the business ownership class over something like a local food bank or even just directly giving money to their unemployed friends and family?<p>And despite your explanations of how the restaurant industry works, I still don’t think the story adds up.

Your clever and elegant but utterly idiosyncratic abstractions are costing me money in terms of getting people onboarded.<p>&gt; In an inflexible language, a lack of clarity can sometimes be unavoidable (e.g. java programmers forced to shoehorn everything into classes)<p>This is not a bad trade-off at all.<p>A flexible language invites architecture astronauts to re-invent the concept of classes or modules over and over in slightly different ways.

            "<i>This Week in Virology</i> has debunked the claims that there multiple strains of the virus that are either more transmissible, or more or less severe, or that your immune system would react differently to.<p>Here is what they had to say in episode 590[1]:<p>Vincent Racaniello: <i>There are a series of articles here, where there have been some claims about different circulating lineages and what that means. Are you on this, Cathy?</i><p>Cathy Spindler: <i>Right. So, there was an article that I first saw in the LA Times &quot;Chinese Scientists Say Second Coronavirus Strain Is More Dangerous&quot;[2]. But in that there&#x27;s a link to virological.org, which we talked about another article posted there a couple of weeks ago[3], and they really debunk this and think even that this Chinese article about a second Coronavirus should be retracted. Two of the key claims that are reached by misunderstanding and overinterpreation of data and an additional analysis suffers from methodological limitations. So this long thing on virological.org goes in to the reasons why there&#x27;s no real evidence for two different strains, a more severe strain and a less severe strain.</i><p>Rich Condit: <i>It also provides a nice summary of this sort of variation in sequence that&#x27;s being observed in the virus over time, which is good.</i><p>Vincent: <i>Yeah, it&#x27;s a good article. We&#x27;ll put a link. It&#x27;s worth reading, but as everyone should know, when these [indistinct] viruses, every replication cycle they sustain mutations in their genomes and the lethal ones are gone, the viruses don&#x27;t reproduce, but some of them stay and if they&#x27;re neutral they remain. So they can be characteristic. So the virus introduced in to the Washington area is a single introduction and then it&#x27;s spread and you can tell that because it has a unique set of mutations compared to say, the Chinese isolate, but it doesn&#x27;t mean anything biologically. It&#x27;s just markers.</i><p>Rich: <i>And the markers are really interesting because they give you insight in to, I mean the insight that I got from observing what came out of the Washington cases is that from looking at the sequence of the virus they concluded that in fact it had been circulating for some time, and they could even get a very very rough estimate of how many cases might be out there based on the variation in sequence and the time at which the disease first showed up in a person.</i><p>Vincent: <i>I think there are some emails later about this. People are concerned that, and people suggest in these papers, at least the one here, that we&#x27;re being critical of that it could be evolved to be more virulent or more transmissible. There&#x27;s no evidence for that whatsoever.</i><p>Rich: <i>This is the kind of thing that... it just won&#x27;t go away!</i><p>Vincent: <i>Oh, it doesn&#x27;t go away... new outbreak and it comes back.</i><p>Rich: <i>Yeah, and there&#x27;s no evidence. People have looked at this. We&#x27;ve gone over this for several.. Zika, Ebola, where&#x27;s there&#x27;s been variation and people point to a particular variation and they say, &quot;This is going to make it more virulent&quot; or something, and then the experiments ultimately get done and no. It hasn&#x27;t made a difference.</i><p>Vincent: <i>And also the issue of increased transmissibility, I think this virus is already very transmissible as it is, and I think the mutations that made it effectively transmissible among humans, which happened very early on, I don&#x27;t know, either in animals or in humans early on, before we knew about it, they&#x27;re done, and it&#x27;s going to be hard to know what they were. MERS coronavirus has never acquired those high transmissibility changes and it keeps fizzling out and then you have another reintroduction from camels but this particular SARS-Cov-2 sustained them probably early on and it&#x27;s a very good transmitter. It doesn&#x27;t need to get better, at least from my anthropocentric view. We never really know what viruses are selected by, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any evidence, and it&#x27;s very hard to get that evidence. That paper tells you what you need to prove that mutations are doing something phenotypically. It&#x27;s very hard to get that.</i><p>Rich: <i>It has occurred to me that people who don&#x27;t think about this stuff every day might be a little confused by this discussion relative to the discussion that goes on all the time about variation in influenza virus strains, and new strains coming up and having to change the vaccine and stuff. But that&#x27;s different. That&#x27;s variation in the influenza virus that makes it evade the existing immunity, and those sorts of variations arise so you get circulation of viruses that you don&#x27;t have as good an immune response to, but that&#x27;s different than a virus making mutations that make it more virulent. It&#x27;s a different story.</i><p>Then they talk about it again in episode 592[4]:<p>Alan Dove: <i>David sends a link to a paper on possibly being two strains of SARS-CoV-2.  This says, &quot;I&#x27;ve seen this pop up.&quot;</i><p>Vincent Racaniello: <i>These are just basically single nucleotide polymorphisms.</i><p>Dove: <i>Oh those, yeah.</i><p>Rich Condit: <i>This is the paper where they were talking about an S-type and an L-type and one maybe being more pathogenic than another and blah blah blah blah.  Basically, yes, there&#x27;s variation in the virus.  It doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean anything.</i><p>Racaniello:  <i>No.  They have no evidence that&#x27;s it&#x27;s functionally of any importance at all.  No.  But he does say &quot;this virus has now conducted many human-to-human transmissions.  Have we discovered mutations that enhance transmission?  Welcome to evolution.&quot;  Well, the problem is you need to have the virus before it started transmitting efficiently among people.  Right?  And we don&#x27;t have that and I&#x27;m not sure we ever will.  But then maybe you could look at it and see what changes occur.  And I&#x27;m not sure you could ever do anything about it because you can&#x27;t infect people and we don&#x27;t have a good animal model for transmission so, no.  Unfortunately we won&#x27;t be able to know about that.</i><p>And in episode 596[5]:<p>Rich Condit:  <i>So the second question is the doctor asking.. It&#x27;s basically, can the virus mutate so you wouldn&#x27;t be immune to it?  And our understanding, my understanding with SARS-CoV-2 now is that there&#x27;s no evidence that it&#x27;s going to undergo what we call antigenic drift, right, that it will be SARS-CoV-2 for the foreseable future, and once you mount an immune response to that you&#x27;ll be immune to it and there won&#x27;t be, as far as we know, new strains coming up to which you will not be immune.  These things, the human coronaviruses seem to be pretty stable over time.  Yes, they can accumulate mutations but they are of essentially no consequence.</i><p>Alan Dove:  <i>And as viruses go, these coronaviruses, because of the proofreading are actually more stable than a lot of other viruses.  Probably what the doctor is thinking of is that this is analogous to flu, where you do see antigenic drift and antigenic shift, and where yeah, you get different strains circulating all the time.  But there&#x27;s no evidence, as Rich said, that SARS-CoV-2 is doing any of that.</i><p>[1] - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microbe.tv&#x2F;twiv&#x2F;twiv-590&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microbe.tv&#x2F;twiv&#x2F;twiv-590&#x2F;</a> at about 13 minutes in<p>[2] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;story&#x2F;2020-03-05&#x2F;chinese-scientists-say-second-coronavirus-strain-more-dangerous\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.latimes.com&#x2F;science&#x2F;story&#x2F;2020-03-05&#x2F;chinese-sci...</a><p>[3] - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;virological.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;response-to-on-the-origin-and-continuing-evolution-of-sars-cov-2&#x2F;418\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;virological.org&#x2F;t&#x2F;response-to-on-the-origin-and-conti...</a><p>[4] - <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microbe.tv&#x2F;twiv&#x2F;twiv-592&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microbe.tv&#x2F;twiv&#x2F;twiv-592&#x2F;</a> at about 1 hour and 41 minutes in<p>[5] - <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microbe.tv&#x2F;twiv&#x2F;twiv-596&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.microbe.tv&#x2F;twiv&#x2F;twiv-596&#x2F;</a> at about 39 minutes in\n",

I looked at reviews for the originals <i>after</i> I bought them and the reviews weren&#x27;t great, so maybe I should have looked at them before...<p>I like the auto-volume adjustment <i>as long as</i> you can put a max volume on it. If the ambient noise is loud, I don&#x27;t want my music to get <i>even louder</i> so I can hear it over the noise; I worry about protecting my hearing. If anything, I&#x27;d rather the buds decide to just turn off if they decide the noise is too loud to play over.\n",

The US had somewhat more ICU beds per capita than Germany, but only about a third of the hospital beds in general, so ICU beds are certainly not the only explanation for why it hasn&#x27;t been quite as bad here.<p>As important as healthcare infrastructure is, it&#x27;s worthless to someone without financial access to it, either directly due to lacking insurance or indirectly due to fear of losing one&#x27;s job due to absence. Extremely few people (but not zero) in Germany would be hesitant to seek treatment for Covid-19 due to either of those worries, compared with a large (and due to the unemployment situation, growing) portion of people in the US. Americans are being told that they won&#x27;t get surprise bills for Covid-10 treatment, but I imagine more than a few have wondered how a visit to the emergency room would affect their finances if they turned out <i>not</i> to have it, and decided to tough it out a bit too long.<p>So, if available healthcare infrastructure and individual financial access to that infrastructure are taken together, Germany looks to be ahead of both the other large EU countries and the US, all of which have suffered more deaths per capita these past few awful weeks.<p>If some of the German states try to get &quot;back to normal&quot; too fast, though, this relatively good situation could change...<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;niallmccarthy&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;12&#x2F;the-countries-with-the-most-critical-care-beds-per-capita-infographic&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.forbes.com&#x2F;sites&#x2F;niallmccarthy&#x2F;2020&#x2F;03&#x2F;12&#x2F;the-co...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oecd-ilibrary.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;health_glance-2017-62-en&#x2F;index.html?itemId=&#x2F;content&#x2F;component&#x2F;health_glance-2017-62-en\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.oecd-ilibrary.org&#x2F;sites&#x2F;health_glance-2017-62-en...</a>\n",

Very few things can be bought, even Amazon is only delivering &quot;essentials.&quot;<p>But more importantly, India has been contact tracing like a greedy algorithm on steroids since case #1. There was a positive case in a condo nearby mine. The entire condominium building and adjacent locality is sealed. Not a lockdown, sealed. Nobody in, nobody out. The authorities spent over 9 hours interviewing all family members, neighbors, and friends of the infected for contact tracing. Every contact is being monitored, with police showing up randomly to make sure of no symptoms and adherence to home quarantine.<p>People are self policing mainly to avoid police, but they are self policing each other because nobody wants their buildings sealed. It really is working, I see people unwilling to hand over their credit cards in shops insisting to tap to avoid infections. In my state, there are only 85 active infections, only 2 are residents of my city, and even then I&#x27;m given gloves and sanitizer when I enter minimarts, with only 10 minute allowance to go and shop with maximum 4 shoppers allowed inside.<p>Edit: It becomes a big news when a positive case is found nearby.

It’s an example of something worth donating to: a non-profit charity organization that can redirect funds to help people in some way.<p>So yes, you can do both things. You can donate to whatever you want.<p>My whole argument here is that donating to a for-profit business is never noble and never logical. If you give money to a for-profit entity you should either receive a product, service, or ownership stake in return.<p>Again, my whole argument is that this crisis has made many people in an act of group-think start considering donating to <i>for profit</i> entities, especially ones that frequently churn in the first place, to be a desirable action. It’s not, full stop. Nobody should do it.<p>Another example: my gym has an option to continue paying dues to support their “employee relief fund.” But the owners of the gym administer this fund. How do I know it won’t be used for profit? It’s not a 503(c) organization. The owners could just keep 90% of it and give 10% to the employees and that would be perfectly legal.<p>So it’s the same thing with all of these hastily-arranged informal restaurant&#x2F;bar donation funds.

Afterwards, the Cuban government then provided 175 pages of documents to FBI agents investigating Posada Carriles&#x27;s (a former CIA operative) role in the 1997 terrorist bombings in Havana, but the FBI failed to use the evidence to follow up on Posada. Instead, they used it to uncover and imprison the Cuban spies, known as the Cuban Five. [18][19]. The Cuban Five said they were spying on Miami&#x27;s Cuban exile community, not the US government. They were imprisoned from 1998, until their eventual release via a prisoner swap in 2014.

India does the same, and it&#x27;s still a mystery.<p>Some points<p>* India has the world&#x27;s most drastic lockdown in order. More stringent than China at their COVID peak.<p>* Indian public health is at the very least experienced, (I think competent as well, but opinions there may vary) with national epidemics.<p>* Indians know what mortality feels like. &lt;- My opinion, but the west simply doesn&#x27;t fear death the same way. For good reason, but in India a silent biological killer of millions is something people intuitively understand. In part due to wounds of Plague, TB, Aids, Malaria and Polio, all being quite fresh in memory.<p>* More fact, Indians also know what national emergencies and curfews feels like. We have had a few in the last few decades, and some have been nearly as drastic.<p>* India relied strongly on ICMR (it&#x27;s medical research body) over WHO or the US&#x27;s recommendations. That included using funding to push a lockdown far earlier into the spread than other nations, consistently recommending masks and contact tracing. On the other hand, testing and ventilator recommendations were not taken and it has worked. The death rate of COVID patients on ventilators is 88%. It is less a life saving device and more an expensive pyre. India has also been smart about running really intelligent statistical tests instead of mass testing. They randomly tested people coming in reporting pneumonia symptoms, they tested randomly sampled population and closely tracked the death rate, instead of spending 100s of millions on testing everyone. (esp. when everyone is 1 billion people) Additionally if high rates of testing only serve to better provide recommendations on distancing, mask wear and lockdowns, then India has jumped to stringent action already, making high rates of testing rather meaningless. (2 week delayed death number spikes are far more reliable for longer term decision making such as when to restart the economy)<p>(also, even more controversial, it doesn&#x27;t help that the Indian intellectual and political left (esp. the Luthiens Delhi crowd), despises the current government, and would rather evangelize and believe in its incompetence, ever get caught giving it credit where it is due. I say this as someone who would be considered a proper social democrat in the US and is not a fan of the current US or Indian Govt.)<p>Is it possible that there are other reasons for why India has low Covid-19 death rates ? -&gt; Of course it is possible.

Load was abysmal, maybe 20 or so people.  Service was the usual surly Egyptair (aka &quot;Misery Air&quot;, <i>Misr</i> being the Arabic name for Egypt) experience, but it was a short flight of only an hour or so.<p>On arrival at GZA, we were driven over to the nearby Rafah border, herded into a holding area, instructed to identify and open our luggage, and then moved to a different room to be frisked and interrogated by Israeli security while another set of guards pawed through the bags, sight unseen.  All staff involved were very much not in a hurry, and all in all, it took about four hours (!) for the 20 of us to go from wheels on the ground to getting into the airport terminal, through Palestinian immigration and then Gaza proper.

Istanbul!).

Well, I pay a mortgage, taxes, utilities, and upkeep.  That is, I&#x27;m saving up now for a roof and a retaining wall (to give better access on one side of the driveway).<p>What value do the renters receive?<p>1.  No risk.  They can walk away, but I still have a 30-year mortgage.  The plumbing can fail.  The roof can leak.  The electric can degrade.  The building can crumble.  I, the owner, have to fix it <i>IF</i> it happens.  The renter does not assume any of that risk.<p>2.  No commitment.  Aside from a short lease (which they agree to the terms), the renter has no long-term obligation to that property.  I, as the owner, have committed to maintaining the property for decades.<p>3.  Access to the property and all of its features.  If you don&#x27;t think that that is value, then try being homeless.<p>4.  Furthermore, I, as the owner, <i>DO NOT</i> have access to the use of the property.  Perhaps for decades.<p>5.  Monopoly?  I cannot think of a single example of a monopoly in land ownership other than the government itself and the threat of eminent domain.  If you don&#x27;t like my terms for lease, then go next door.  Different owner, different terms.  Or buy your own.<p>6.  Initial Investment.  I, as an owner, had to save for years to consolidate the capital for the down payment of that property.  That means that, for years, I did not party, buy the latest technology, eat at moderately-priced restaurants, go on vacation, buy a shiny new vehicle, purchase concert tickets, etc.  I deprived myself of entertainment and luxery to, instead, work multiple jobs, with the intent of having a rental property.<p>7.  Improvement.  I improve the property.  If I do not pay someone to do it, then it is me doing it myself.  I refinished the hardwood floors.  I fixed drywall and painted.  I removed old ductwork.  I provide appliances.  I provide furnishing (I rent to students, after all).  I put the labor into the property, further depriving myself of other more enjoyable activity.<p>I&#x27;m sorry, but I completely disagree with your restrictive definition of what of &quot;rent&quot; represents.  Rent is compensation for my years of preparation and self-denial of the reward for my own personal labor.  Rent is the fee that the renter pays for not having done the same.  Rent is never pure profit.  Rent is a continual financial planning for the upkeep and sustaining of the investment.<p>Do I benefit from my investment?  Yes.<p>Do I feel guilty about it?  No.<p>Should I feel guilty about it?  Never.<p>If you are mad at a landlord for having to pay rent, then dig yourself out of that situation.  What if it takes years?  Welcome to the club.  Do it anyway.  So what if you have to move?  Again, welcome to the club.  Do it anyway.  So what if the landlord is wealthy?  Wealth has to come from somewhere, and if your current financial strategy isn&#x27;t making you wealthy, then change it.  It will probably take a lifetime to do, but then again, that&#x27;s probably what your landlord did (or is in the process of doing).\n",

But although wood heat is a complex issue, I don&#x27;t think you are correct here.   Having looked at it pretty closely, I think modern wood heat is good solution for homes in the rural Northeastern US.<p>Yes, air pollution is a big problem.  Modern catalytic stoves are much lower on particulate emissions than older models.  The one we have (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.woodstove.com&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;progress-hybrid\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.woodstove.com&#x2F;index.php&#x2F;progress-hybrid</a>) has about 1&#x2F;10 the emissions of older models. Efficiency is also about 30% higher, which reduces CO2 emissions. With a reasonably designed system (draft that draws in outside air) indoor pollution isn&#x27;t particularly an issue.  Locally harvested wood is quite sustainable, and very close to CO2 neutral.   We manage our forest land, and cutting wood is an essential part of this management.  And mentally, it really is pleasing to feel in control of the whole process --- cut trees, burn trees, grow more trees.<p>Since we&#x27;re not on natural gas, the best alternative at this point would probably be a solar system and an electric heat pump.   As we get older, and are are less able to harvest our own wood, we&#x27;ll look into it more seriously.  I think for right now, though, wood burning makes good sense for us both financially and ecologically. That said, I would be interested to see any sources you might have that compare modern efficient wood stoves with the alternatives.\n",

Electric risks you batteries that hold little charge, diesel risk a visible dripping fuel leak that won’t burn if you drop a match on it, hydrogen leak risks you an invisible gas cloud building over your car that turns into the Hindenburg at the static zap of you touching the door handle.<p>Everywhere already has electric infrastructure, and fancy new batteries like (vanadium redox flow?) can help grid long term storage and balance and electric power can easily be created and transported by solar and wind; nowhere has hydrogen infrastructure and it can’t easily be created or transported and by the time you’ve built that up and compressed enough hydrogen to be useful or chilled enough to a liquid, you’ve spent lots and wrecked its overall energy efficiency.<p>I’d more expect someone to come out with a fast charge 15mile graphene (or other panacea magic words) “battery” which handles commutes and hybrid with li-ion for longer journeys than hydrogen to get big within 30 years.<p>Even more compelling, BMW i3 has lithium ion with a petrol generator range extender, and that seems the perfect combination of short range electric with the option of topping up at any gas station for quick refuels, it completely solves the electric range problem - with a smaller simpler cheaper “engine” not coupled to the drive wheels. I don’t know why other makers haven’t offered that, but BMW are dropping it as an option because range is good enough now. But it’s a better fix than hydrogen - fits current infrastructure and driver understanding.<p>Volkswagen is going to be pumping out the all electric ID3 from 2025 in Volkswagen quantities. Not an electric conversion of a gas model, an all electric design. That’s my marker for “electric cars are mainstream, unquestionably”.\n",

            "SARS-CoV-2 is a single-segmented, double-stranded RNA virus. There are no genes being &quot;collected&quot;, just two complementary RNA strands that are replicated directly from source RNA and wound into a packed structure by helicases. Gene deletions are extraordinarily uncommon for most viruses, because viruses don&#x27;t generally carry around entire non-essential genes. SNPs and small indels are indeed common, and because the genome is well-annotated, many of them can be characterized into synonymous, non-synonymous structurally significant&#x2F;insignificant, frameshift, or non-coding mutations. In the case where a mutation appears to disrupt a gene through a frameshift or structurally significant mutation, further evidence is needed (like multiple independent isolates) that the mutation is not a sequencing artifact.<p>In the case of the link that OP posted (<a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk&#x2F;#&#x2F;deletion\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk&#x2F;#&#x2F;deletion</a>), only non-frameshifting deletions in coding regions are listed. Most deletions listed are one- or two- codon deletions observed in multiple isolates, which is good evidence. Aside from the terminology issues, OP&#x27;s claim that some of these deletions may result in an attenuated virus is plausible, subject to further analysis of the structural effect of these mutations (which can be modeled in silico). I don&#x27;t think it would be useful to &quot;go and visit the people who were infected with each of the different deletion strains and investigate what was their clinical outcome&quot; as OP suggests, since that would be confounded by many factors.<p>Trying to isolate live attenuated virus from the human population in this way carries a lot of risks and potential ethical issues, and amounts to a very low-throughput, difficult screen. The far higher throughput, better researched method that labs are prepared to do is to infect an animal (possibly genetically engineered to be more human-like in its molecular machinery) and wait for the virus to evolve to target that animal, which will make it less virulent in human. However, for SARS-CoV-2 this is especially tricky because of how explosively fast its replication cycle is. Most vaccine trials for coronavirus are working on presenting the human immune system with pieces of the virus instead of live attenuated virus.<p>I would encourage everyone in this thread to read the scientific literature on this, which is abundant and freely available, for example this review: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;nrd.2015.37.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nature.com&#x2F;articles&#x2F;nrd.2015.37.pdf</a>\n",

It just reduces contagion vectors so it spreads more slowly.  The virus still spreads, though.  Eventually, enough of the population will catch the virus and build up a resistance to it so that herd immunity kicks in.

They are <i>not</i> arbitrary variables, but represent inputs to the program. The mental model is a function that produces the same output given the same inputs. Think of a dropdown, where the associated state variable D my have values a, b or c, depending on what the user chooses. The render function simply does not care how the value of D was set, and renders the exact same jsx given a specific D value: jsxa for a, jsxb for b and jsxc for c. That is as pure as it gets. Furthermore, the dropdown state variable D <i>never</i> represents the intermediate computation of some other component[s], and it&#x27;s <i>never</i> changed by other components arbitrarily based only on the variable name.<p>The use of &quot;dynamic scoping&quot; to describe React Hooks state is unnecessarily imprecise, implying that a fairly well designed system is a mess. Please don&#x27;t engage in FUD.<p>Tip: Never call setFoo functions from render code. Only call setFoo from event code.\n",

Additionally, it concerns me that official solutions to some problems (e.g. iterating on an enum) require you to write around the code that the compiler will generate.

One might argue whether this can perhaps fall within the E2EE definition and shift the discussion to whether we should weaken the definition of E2EE to unambiguously include TOFU, but the question whether my analysis is correct remains: is there a way to verify Keybase&#x27;s end-to-end encryption between me and a friend, or do I just have to trust the server&#x27;s initial key?<p>It seems weird for Keybase to make a claim that is not in line with what I think is the common understanding of E2EE, so I&#x27;d love if someone else can also read all the docs and post an answer to either confirm it or prove it wrong. Maybe the Keybase authors could chip in, and one of the auditors is also the highest ranked user on the security stackexchange site so I had some hope that he would answer (I also sent him an email). It is now tied for the highest voted unanswered question on the site and someone opened a bounty on the question for more attention but it hasn&#x27;t elicited answers so far (that&#x27;s actually why I posted it here for attention: someone with only 100 rep whom I don&#x27;t know opened a bounty for 50 rep, and I don&#x27;t want it to go to waste). If someone here knows more, a definitive answer would be welcome!\n",

            "I wrote thousands of tasks over the years, and all of them were written for remote team members. And for most of them I needed a big canvas to explain everything, utilizing a combination of written paragraphs and images to make my vision clear. I don’t like to have to attach my images at the end of a document, but rather to integrate them in order to better explain the text. But tools like Trello and Asana didn&#x27;t satisfy me because the text field is small and images attached at the end and not within a description.<p>I want my images to be placed right after the text they relate to, because I want my readers to be able to review all visuals before moving on to the next paragraph. This is why I favor text representation such as Medium, where images are first-class citizens used to enhance descriptions, and are not treated like an afterthought or text appendix. When creating task descriptions, I frequently needed to include screenshots from the live website or from a prototyping tool to better explain what needed to be done, so I used OneNote (note-taking tool from Microsoft) or good old-fashioned emails (add text, images, files — everything kept within a single message). OneNote, despite its simplicity, didn’t work all that reliably for document sharing, so once I discovered Dropbox’s Paper two years ago, I instantly switched to it.<p>Eventually, I realised that what I wanted was to use a mix of Paper and Github, so a “single task at a time” interface with rich task descriptions, along with category&#x2F;people assignment features.

The economy makes the rent go up because the people living there are more productive—not because the landlords are more productive!

This is far outside my area.<p>None that I know of as its unlikely to be a good idea outside of a breeding program because of the opportunity costs; I imagine staples like wheat&#x2F;rice&#x2F;potatoes confined to such limited scale&#x2F;size would not be able to recover the costs if profit from yield is the only source for ROI in its current model.<p>&gt; I was trying to suggest greenhouses for staple crops like rice or wheat, so that the overproduction margin for famine years could be significantly reduced rather than totally eliminated.<p>Perishability is an inherit and unavoidable factor, and famines are not uniform throughout the Earth which is why I think optimizing the Global Food Supply Chain, rather than entirely abandoning it is the goal; the Citrus Industry in Florida nearly collapsed a few years ago due to a psyllid issue that destroyed nearly 1&#x2F;2 of Florida&#x27;s orange groves [1], only to find out in PR (after failed studies in China and Mexico) where topology differences revealed that its preferable to grow citrus at higher elevation to avoid the disease they were seeing below that--after a certain elevation, reported at 600M, the groves weren&#x27;t as susceptible to infestation from the psyllid.<p>Having data, metrics and analytics in place accessible in Real Time in a readily available and comprehensible system for producers to work with is critical moving forward in the 21st Century; adapting an Ag model to suit this is no longer a luxury but has become a necessity if we have any chance of surviving on this planet as Climate Change, and nearly unpredictable weather patterns&#x2F;disasters are becoming ever more prevalent and even more severe.<p>Again, the opportunity costs in not addressing this problem is so unbelievably immense to anyone who takes the time to just look; we can see the 2 million chicken culling and its subsequent waste and be outraged--and it would be justifiable--but more importantly I hope it serves as indication of what is seen as common practices and serves as a catalyst for change as this cannot go on any longer without severe widely felt repercussions.<p>1: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;speaking-of-science&#x2F;wp&#x2F;2015&#x2F;01&#x2F;20&#x2F;one-way-to-beat-a-bug-thats-destroying-floridas-citrus-get-them-high&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.washingtonpost.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;speaking-of-science&#x2F;wp&#x2F;2...</a>\n",

Literally, ONE WORD in the dictionary. And you need to Shift that &#x27;ù&#x27; key to get &#x27;%&#x27;. How stupid is that...<p>I won&#x27;t even comment on the weird &#x27;M&#x27; position, which shortens the bottom row (index hits no letter, it&#x27;s a symbol...) Like WTF, seriously.<p>Also, top row requires Shift for numbers... (no modifier yields symbols...) What a strange, impractical decision. Every number requires pressing a modifier, but underscore or &#x27;&amp;&#x27; do not... Sure, yeah, OK.<p>Should we talk about period &#x27;.&#x27; requiring a Shift, but not &#x27;;&#x27; No, no we shouldn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not like a period is common in language...<p>I thus call it &#x27;weirdest&#x27;, because it&#x27;s as far as it gets from ANSI, and it has to be the worst ISO I&#x27;ve ever tried altogether. The question is, why do it so differently? Why not change <i>as little as necessary</i> based on ANSI? Was it a misguided sense of cultural appropriation? Did they like torturing typists and programmers alike?<p>So one day, as I was learning programming, I decided to stop fighting my keyboard, to preserve my sanity (and limit RSI).<p>QWERTY US (ANSI) is simply the best for tech (IT, prog). Not necessarily inherently (although it&#x27;s very good for language), but because of the chicken-and-the-egg: most software is designed by&#x2F;for US companies and programmers, so symbols like e.g. []{}|&#x2F; are used in programming, bash, tools, because they are <i>easy</i> to use on a QWERTY keyboard. And I vastly prefer the 1-row wide Enter to the inverted-L shaped ISO style (less RSI-inducing on the right pinky).<p>For non-US programmers, there&#x27;s life <i>before</i>, and <i>after</i> switching to ANSI-US. I&#x27;m not even kidding, it&#x27;s a life-changer in simplicity, comfort (ergonomics) and generally intuition— e.g. there&#x27;s a reason why ()[]{} are close by. And it lets one buy keyboards anywhere (you&#x27;ll always find QWERTY, but good luck finding ISO-XX in country YY.<p>Thank you to anyone who read this. I hope you feel the pain.

In an era where &quot;surveillance is democratized,&quot; how we think about the existence of &quot;private information&quot; might radically change. In your example, the words, actions, and ideas that would have generated controversy might not have ever been spoken or acted upon in the first place, or there would be such an apparent abundance that the &quot;controversy&quot; wouldn&#x27;t hold ground.

These things tend to be pretty complicated and expensive as well. It&#x27;s all about operational cost vs revenue in the end (and comparing that to other solutions). IMHO wind and solar are still making great leaps currently in cost effectiveness and efficiency. So you&#x27;d have to compete with&#x2F;undercut that. Which is of course a challenge for just about any other form of energy generation currently (particularly anything nuclear of fossil fuel based).<p>The added advantage of this setup would be that you can land the things during a storm or for maintenance which potentially simplifies e.g. in the field repairs. Also, if they can be small enough that they can be mounted on a truck, deployment might be quicker or you might be able to re-deploy them to other areas. Currently building a new wind mill park is a large investment. Mass production of these things might enable more rapid roll out. So there are some upsides theoretically.<p>Safety might be a bigger issue. The cables would be a risk for planes and what happens if the cable snaps? Autonomous drones would be able to handle the latter probably (by crashing&#x2F;landing in some safe spot). Also, lots of moving parts means those parts need more frequent maintenance&#x2F;replacement.

If we assume the same laws exist everywhere (quite reasonable) then ET must follow those same laws too.<p>First, you have to be generating the energy. No reactor or conversion process can be 100% efficient (second law), so you must reject some heat. If it&#x27;s solar, you have big-ass solar panels that get hot because they are not 100% efficient. The ISS looks like an orbiting Christmas tree in the infrared.<p>Second, the &quot;rocket&quot; exhaust might be a directed particle beam but whatever is accelerating that exhaust cannot be 100% efficient (second law again). More rejected heat.<p>Then you have all the other stuff going on. If the inhabitants are biological, life support for a long-duration large scale space flight is going to be pretty energetically expensive. Think of growing crops, bulk biosynthesis of nutrients, and a whole lot of recycling which usually involves a lot of endothermic reactions to break down waste products. If the inhabitants are post-biological (IMHO more likely for star travelers) then you have a whole lot of computronium of some kind. It&#x27;s either high temperature like ours in which case it makes a lot of heat. A CPU is a very ornate resistance heater. If it&#x27;s low temperature like superconducting or quantum you&#x27;re running a heat pump. Either way any AI-based ETs are a big flying data center in space, and data centers always talk about how much energy they have to burn for cooling.<p>... I could keep going forever.<p>You can reclaim a bit of heat like we do here on Earth with combined-cycle power plants, but there are absolute, hard, inescapable limits to how much.<p>You&#x27;re gonna need a radiator, and there is no way to make that not visible. If you want to hide from the crazy-ass monkeys on the third planet you could try flying with a reflector in the way to block your heat from the Earth-Moon system and reflect it elsewhere, but the problem is that now your reflector will reflect a bunch of incident solar radiation!<p>Last but not least: we are in theory talking about interstellar visitors here. Anything capable of interstellar travel is by definition capable of generating absolutely vast mind-boggling amounts of energy. The only physical power planets we know of that could theoretically propel you to the stars (at a reasonable enough speed) are some mix of fusion and matter-antimatter annihilation. Even turning that monster of a power plant on to &quot;idle mode&quot; is going to say &quot;here I am!&quot; in the infrared... if someone is actually looking.

The outcome of a SCOTUS decision is &quot;wrong&quot; insofar as it incorrectly determines the legality of something, not whether or not it produces politically unfavorable outcomes.<p>Second of all, in practice, the influence of money in politics is overstated.<p>Hillary Clinton outspent[1][2] Donald Trump by 2x in the 2016 election, and still lost. In fact, she had far more corporate backing[3][4] than Donald Trump, and still lost.<p>In the 2020 Democratic Primaries, Michael Bloomberg spent $1 billion[5] (!!) on his campaign, and won just 9.4% of the popular vote (1.38% of pledged delegates).<p>Tom Steyer (a no-name billionaire), spent $343 million[6] on his election, and won a humiliating 0.38% of the popular vote (0% of pledged delegates). Interestingly, you would think he would have at least 1&#x2F;3 of Bloomberg&#x27;s vote, which suggests that the vast majority of the variance in Bloomberg&#x27;s vote share can be attributed to his existing name recognition as a famous businessman&#x2F;politician.<p>Bernie Sanders spent $195 million[7] on his election, having spent less than Bloomberg + Steyer and while having handily beaten both. Joe Biden spent $105 million[8] on his campaign, less than Bernie, and still beat him by 3 million votes.<p>Elizabeth Warren spent $121.31 million[9] on her campaign, and also handily beat Bloomberg + Steyer while having spent far less than them, while losing to Biden while having spent more than him.<p>Those are just the anecdotes (of which there are many more).<p>Decades of research[10] suggest that money probably isn’t the deciding factor in who wins a general election, and especially not for incumbents. Most of the research in the last century found[11] that spending didn’t affect wins for incumbents and that the impact for challengers was unclear[12]. Even the studies[13] that showed spending having the biggest effect, like one that found a more than 6 percent increase in vote share for incumbents, didn’t demonstrate that money actually causes wins. In fact, those gains from spending likely translate to less of an advantage today, in a time period where voters are more stridently partisan. There are probably fewer and fewer people who are going to change their vote because they liked your ad.<p>So this argument is dubious both legally as well as prescriptively.<p>[1] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opensecrets.org&#x2F;pres16&#x2F;candidate?id=n00000019\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opensecrets.org&#x2F;pres16&#x2F;candidate?id=n00000019</a><p>[2] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opensecrets.org&#x2F;pres16&#x2F;candidate?id=n00023864\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opensecrets.org&#x2F;pres16&#x2F;candidate?id=n00023864</a><p>[3] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opensecrets.org&#x2F;pres16&#x2F;contributors?id=n00000019\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opensecrets.org&#x2F;pres16&#x2F;contributors?id=n00000019</a><p>[4] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opensecrets.org&#x2F;pres16&#x2F;contributors?id=n00023864\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opensecrets.org&#x2F;pres16&#x2F;contributors?id=n00023864</a><p>[5] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opensecrets.org&#x2F;2020-presidential-race&#x2F;candidate?id=N00029349\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opensecrets.org&#x2F;2020-presidential-race&#x2F;candidate...</a><p>[6] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opensecrets.org&#x2F;2020-presidential-race&#x2F;candidate?id=N00044966\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opensecrets.org&#x2F;2020-presidential-race&#x2F;candidate...</a><p>[7] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opensecrets.org&#x2F;2020-presidential-race&#x2F;candidate?id=N00000528\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opensecrets.org&#x2F;2020-presidential-race&#x2F;candidate...</a><p>[8] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opensecrets.org&#x2F;2020-presidential-race&#x2F;candidate?id=N00001669\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opensecrets.org&#x2F;2020-presidential-race&#x2F;candidate...</a><p>[9] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opensecrets.org&#x2F;2020-presidential-race&#x2F;candidate?id=N00033492\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.opensecrets.org&#x2F;2020-presidential-race&#x2F;candidate...</a><p>[10] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;papers.ssrn.com&#x2F;sol3&#x2F;papers.cfm?abstract_id=2605401\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;papers.ssrn.com&#x2F;sol3&#x2F;papers.cfm?abstract_id=2605401</a><p>[11] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.sagepub.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1177&#x2F;0002764203260415\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;journals.sagepub.com&#x2F;doi&#x2F;10.1177&#x2F;0002764203260415</a><p>[12] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jstor.org&#x2F;stable&#x2F;2138764?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.jstor.org&#x2F;stable&#x2F;2138764?seq=1#metadata_info_tab...</a><p>[13] <a href=\"http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sas.rochester.edu&#x2F;psc&#x2F;clarke&#x2F;214&#x2F;Gerber98.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.sas.rochester.edu&#x2F;psc&#x2F;clarke&#x2F;214&#x2F;Gerber98.pdf</a>\n",

The experience of the outcome of mismanaging a response to a previous epidemic is still “fresh” so to say in many of these countries. I think a good example of this is how South Korea dealt with SARS and evolved their response to COVID based on the learnings from that.<p>Lastly I wonder if the prevalence of more communal societies in Asian cultures make a difference.

Cameras tend to be mounted up high to deter casual vandalism. As for number plate recognition systems - the ancient trick of stealing a set of number plates from a random vehicle is alive and well. As long as it doesn&#x27;t ping anything as the car moves along it is effectively a ghost until the theft of the plate is reported. The only time I have heard of this back-firing is when there is a problem with the stolen number plate (e.g. No insurance, Intel markers etc).\n",
